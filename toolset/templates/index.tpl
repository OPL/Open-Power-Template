<p>Welcome to the OPT Toolset! The script is intended to allow the programmers to configure various aspects of the library.
It is the extension of the "OPT Configurator" tool included in the first versions of OPT. The available options are:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Configurator - a preprocessor that allows to remove the unnecessary features from the library source code.</li>
 <li>Compiler - an external template compiling tool, which may be used, if the scripts enable the "performance" directive in the
library.</li>
 <li>Help - a description of the features available to remove.</li>
</ol>
