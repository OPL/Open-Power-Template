Title: Reporting bugs
Appendix: Yes

----

Open Power Template bugtracker is located at [OPT Github repository](https://github.com/OPL/Open-Power-Libs/issues). If you find any bug, please report it there.

How to use the bugtracker?
==========================

1. In order to report a bug, you must have a valid [Github](http://www.github.com) account.
2. If it is possible, the report should contain a standalone test case that is ready to run. This will speed up reproducing the bug on our computers and creating the patch. If we cannot reproduce the bug, probably it will not be fixed.
3. Include the information on OPT and PHP versions, as well as other projects that could interfere with the library.
4. Please describe the expected behavior and the actual result.
5. We include the full error message, if it is provided.
6. The report **must be written in English**.
7. Remember: if we need extra information, we will ask for them.
