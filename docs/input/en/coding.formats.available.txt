Title: Available data formats

----

There are five default data formats available in OPT, and three features they may implement:

1. Ordinary variables
2. Sections
3. Section elements

In this chapter, we will describe them and show, how they should be used.

Available formats
=================

`Generic`
:	The default format, implements variables, sections and section elements.

`SingleArray`
:	Very similar to `Generic`. The only difference is how the child section data are handled.

`Objective`
:	Implements variables, sections and section elements. Assumes that the data are objects that may implement one of the standard interfaces, like `Iterator` in case of sections.

`StaticGenerator`
:	The format that generates the data on the fly when they are really needed. It implements only sections.

`RuntimeGenerator`
:	Similar to `StaticGenerator`, but if no generator is provided, it assumes that the script assigned some static data for the sections.
