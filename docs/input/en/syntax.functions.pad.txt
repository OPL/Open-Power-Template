Title: pad()
VersionSince: 2.0.5
Reference: mixed pad(mixed $value, int $length [, string $padString, [, string $paddingType]])

----

Pads a string `$value` to a certain length with another string. If the input string length is greater than or equal to `$length`, no padding takes place. Otherwise, the string is padded with `$padSymbol` symbols which are spaces by default. `$paddingType` specifies the padding type:

# `right` - pads on the right (default)
# `left` - pads on the left.
# `both` - pads on the both sides.

> [warning]
> `$padString` can be truncated if the number of padded characters is not evenly divided by the `$padSymbol` length.

> This function can operate also on a container of strings, padding all of them and returning the modified container.
