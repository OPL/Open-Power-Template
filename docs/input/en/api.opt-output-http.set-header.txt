Reference: boolean setHeader($name, $value)
Status: public

----

Sends a HTTP header, sanitizing its value by removing the new line characters. If the configuration directive `headerBuffering` is disabled, the new header is sent instantly, otherwise it is buffered and sent together with the rendered view.

The method returns **false**, if the headers have been already sent.
