Open Power Template 2.0
=======================

Open Power Template is a template engine for PHP5 that features XML and declarative
programming as a template language. The primary goal is to focus on what you want
to get, not - how it is supposed to work.

The project belongs to the Open Power Libs foundation.

Version 2.0 status
------------------

2.0 is the current stable branch of Open Power Template. You can be pretty
sure there will be no outstanding problems, so it can be safely used in
third party projects.
