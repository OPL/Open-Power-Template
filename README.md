Open Power Template 2.1-dev
===========================

Open Power Template is a template engine for PHP5 that features XML and declarative
programming as a template language. The primary goal is to focus on what you want
to get, not - how it is supposed to work.

The project belongs to the Open Power Libs foundation.

Version 2.1 status
------------------

2.1 is the new development branch which brings lot of improvements and features.
